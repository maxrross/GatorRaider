# GatorRaider
Gator Raider is a controller implementation project that enhances the decision-making process in a Pac-Man-style game using the Gator Raider library. It employs various states to define the actions taken by the player in the game. With the help of the AttackerController interface, it manipulates the behavior of the 'Attacker' in the game. The algorithm calculates distances to game items like power pills and vulnerable enemies, and based on these distances, decides the next best action. If enemies are vulnerable, the algorithm ensures the player chases them. If there are no vulnerable enemies and power pills are available, it positions the player close to a power pill until enemies approach. In the absence of power pills, the algorithm guides the player to the nearest regular pill.
